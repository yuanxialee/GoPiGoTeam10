Using obstacle instance and block objects, form edges and vertices in order iterate through obstacles

Creating paths:
	set of obstacles
	get first obstacle 
	if vertex in the same obstacle set, don't connect to those vertices;
	try to connect to every other obstacle's vertices (go through obstacle by obstacle):
		while attempting to connect each of the current obstacles vertices to the rest (beyond its own),
		check intersections at EVERY OBSTACLE SEGMENT INCLUDING ITS OWN 
		if no intersection:
			make an edge
